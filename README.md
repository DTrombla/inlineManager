Use this Bash app to manage employees of your company.

## Installation
Download MySQL Workbench and create a connection on port 3306. 
Clone the repository and edit the index.js file so that on line 12 your password is in the quotations. Copy the content of the employeeSchema.sql file into your MySQL page. Lastly run "node index.js" in your terminal, if this fails then try deleting the package.json, package-lock.json files, and the node_modules/ folder, then reinstall inquirer and mysql in bash using "npm init", then "npm i inquirer", then "npm i mysql".
